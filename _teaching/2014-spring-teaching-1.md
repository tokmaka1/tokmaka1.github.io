I have been an active teaching assistant for Dominik Baumannâ€™s Digital and Optimal Control course since September 2023. My responsibilities initially included designing and leading exercise sessions as well as grading exams. Since 2025, I have transitioned from leading exercise sessions to delivering lectures. In particular, I now teach the lecture on Discretization as well as my own lecture on [Model Predictive Control and Convex Optimization](/files/12_MPC_convex_optimization.pdf).
