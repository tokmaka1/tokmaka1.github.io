## Digital and Optimal Control
*Graduate course, Aalto University, since 2023*

I have been an active teaching assistant for Dominik Baumann’s Digital and Optimal Control course since September 2023. My responsibilities initially included designing and leading exercise sessions as well as grading exams. Since 2025, I have transitioned from leading exercise sessions to delivering lectures.
In particular, I now teach the lecture on Discretization as well as my own lecture on [Model Predictive Control and Convex Optimization](/files/12_MPC_convex_optimization.pdf).
