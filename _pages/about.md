I am a doctoral researcher in the [Cyber-Physical Systems Group](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-electrical-engineering-and-automation/cyber-physical-systems) at Aalto University in Espoo, Finland. I am supervised by [Dominik Baumann](https://baumanndominik.github.io/) and advised by [Thomas Schön](https://www.uu.se/en/contact-and-organisation/staff?query=N13-1742).
My research lies at the intersection of machine learning, nonparametric approximation, automatic control, and optimization. In particular, I focus on safe control parameter tuning for single- and multi-agent systems, with an emphasis on Bayesian optimization and kernel methods.

I received my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Mechanical Engineering from RWTH Aachen University, Germany, in 2020 and 2022, respectively. I conducted my master’s thesis at ETH Zurich under the joint supervision of [Johannes Köhler](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ih4hh-8AAAAJ&hl=en), [Christian Fiedler](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=93Qt_hgAAAAJ&hl=en), [Melanie Zeilinger](https://idsc.ethz.ch/research-zeilinger/people/person-detail.MTQyNzM3.TGlzdC8xOTI5LDg4NTM5MTE3.html), and [Sebastian Trimpe](https://www.dsme.rwth-aachen.de/cms/dsme/das-institut/team/~jlolt/prof-sebastian-trimpe/?allou=1).
In recognition of my academic achievements, I was awarded the [Springorum Commemorative Coin](https://www.maschinenbau.rwth-aachen.de/cms/maschinenbau/die-fakultaet/profil/preise-und-auszeichnungen/~dywf/springorum-denkmuenze/?Springorum-Denkmuenze=1000&lidx=1) for my Master’s degree and the [Friedrich-Wilhelm Award](https://www.dsme.rwth-aachen.de/cms/dsme/das-institut/aktuelle-meldungen/~bergpy/abdullah-tokmak-receives-friedrich-wilhelm-award/?lidx=1) for my Master’s thesis, both from RWTH Aachen University.
