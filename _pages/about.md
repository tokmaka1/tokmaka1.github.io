I am a doctoral researcher at the [Cyber-physical systems group](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-electrical-engineering-and-automation/cyber-physical-systems) of Aalto University, Espoo, Finland. 
I am supervised by [Dominik Baumann](https://baumanndominik.github.io/) and advised by [Thomas Schön](https://www.uu.se/en/contact-and-organisation/staff?query=N13-1742). 
My research interest lies at the intersection of machine learning, nonparametric approximation, automatic control, and optimization.
Particularly, I work on safe control parameter tuning in single- and multi-agent systems with a specific focus on Bayesian optimization and kernel methods.

I received my B.Sc.\ and M.Sc.\ degrees in mechanical engineering from RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany, in 2020 and 2022, respectively.
I conducted my master’s thesis research at ETH Zurich in 2022 under the joint supervision of [Johannes Köhler]([https://idsc.ethz.ch/the-institute/people/person-detail.Mjg2NzQx.TGlzdC82MjMsMjA4ODk3NDEzOQ==.html](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ih4hh-8AAAAJ&hl=en)), [Christian Fiedler](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=93Qt_hgAAAAJ&hl=en), [Melanie Zeilinger](https://idsc.ethz.ch/research-zeilinger/people/person-detail.MTQyNzM3.TGlzdC8xOTI5LDg4NTM5MTE3.html), and [Sebastian Trimpe](https://www.dsme.rwth-aachen.de/cms/dsme/das-institut/team/~jlolt/prof-sebastian-trimpe/?allou=1).
In 2023, I received the [Springorium Commemorative Coin](https://www.maschinenbau.rwth-aachen.de/cms/maschinenbau/die-fakultaet/profil/preise-und-auszeichnungen/~dywf/springorum-denkmuenze/?Springorum-Denkmuenze=1000&lidx=1) for my Master's degree and the [Friedrich-Wilhelm Award](https://www.dsme.rwth-aachen.de/cms/dsme/das-institut/aktuelle-meldungen/~bergpy/abdullah-tokmak-receives-friedrich-wilhe/?lidx=1) for my Master's thesis, both from RWTH Aachen University.
